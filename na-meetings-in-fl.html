                          <p>The state of Florida has been a hub for addiction treatment for a number of years. This is the case for several reasons. First, the beautiful weather makes it a desirable destination that those seeking recovery are willing to travel to. Second, it has a highly active recovery scene with tons of fellowships of Alcoholics Anonymous, Narcotics Anonymous, and more. Third, the high density of providers ensures that access to high quality and specialized treatment programs are never out of reach.&nbsp;</p>

                          <p>First, one should acknowledge what level of care they require. Those who have developed a physical dependence on a substance should seek a treatment center that offers medical detox. Reputation and accreditation are other factors that should be considered when evaluating a treatment center. Lastly, consider what kind of specialized programs might be attractive and what a particular rehab provides. Examples of specialized recovery programs include faith-based recovery, medication-assisted treatment, yoga therapy, adventure therapy, and more.&nbsp;</p>

                           <p>Most people assume that they cannot afford private addiction treatment. However, many of even the most luxurious rehabs accept medical insurance which may cover the majority of the expense. Even state-funded insurance policies like Medicare and Medicaid offer coverage for substance abuse treatment.&nbsp;</p>
