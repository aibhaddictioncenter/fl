                          <p>The state of Florida has been a hub for addiction treatment for a number of years. This is the case for several reasons. First, the beautiful weather makes it a desirable destination that those seeking recovery are willing to travel to. Second, it has a highly active recovery scene with tons of fellowships of Alcoholics Anonymous, Narcotics Anonymous, and more. Third, the high density of providers ensures that access to high quality and specialized treatment programs are never out of reach.&nbsp;</p>

                          <p>First, one should acknowledge what level of care they require. Those who have developed a physical dependence on a substance should seek a treatment center that offers medical detox. Reputation and accreditation are other factors that should be considered when evaluating a treatment center. Lastly, consider what kind of specialized programs might be attractive and what a particular rehab provides. Examples of specialized recovery programs include faith-based recovery, medication-assisted treatment, yoga therapy, adventure therapy, and more.&nbsp;</p>

                           <p>Most people assume that they cannot afford private addiction treatment. However, many of even the most luxurious rehabs accept medical insurance which may cover the majority of the expense. Even state-funded insurance policies like Medicare and Medicaid offer coverage for substance abuse treatment.&nbsp;</p>

                <p class="display-7"> <p>Even though the process of detoxing from alcohol and drugs isn&#39;t easy, there are many advantages for seeking help from a Florida rehab. For instance, the warm climate can help the body cope with the physical effects of the withdrawal process. There may be withdrawal-related symptoms such as pain, insomnia or flu-like symptoms. Additionally, colder weather can cause symptoms to worsen, so Florida&#39;s climate is an ideal environment for treatment. Additionally, Florida is home to some of the nation&#39;s most highly trained mental and medical health specialists in the field of addiction.</p>

<p>Annual surveys are conducted by the Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration to assess the availability of treatment for addiction services across the 50 United States states and the District of Columbia. According to the survey 617 Florida rehab facilities were available in the year 2011. This indicates that Florida is in high demand for alcohol and drug treatment. Florida is home to many well-known rehab centers. The state is also home to numerous detox centers for alcohol. No matter where you reside, Florida has excellent treatment centers that can assist you to overcome your alcohol and drug addiction.</p>

<p>Although Florida addiction treatment centers share the same visions, there are distinct differences in the services they offer. Not all Florida rehab centers provide detoxification services, but the majority do. To detoxify the body of the effects of drugs it is essential that you undergo a medically-supervised detoxification procedure prior to starting treatment. In addition there are a few Florida rehab facilities offer dual diagnosis or trauma treatment. Some of them offer a 14-28-day rehabilitation program, while others offer extended or intensive programs.</p>
