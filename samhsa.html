                          <p>The state of Florida has been a hub for addiction treatment for a number of years. This is the case for several reasons. First, the beautiful weather makes it a desirable destination that those seeking recovery are willing to travel to. Second, it has a highly active recovery scene with tons of fellowships of Alcoholics Anonymous, Narcotics Anonymous, and more. Third, the high density of providers ensures that access to high quality and specialized treatment programs are never out of reach.&nbsp;</p>

                          <p>First, one should acknowledge what level of care they require. Those who have developed a physical dependence on a substance should seek a treatment center that offers medical detox. Reputation and accreditation are other factors that should be considered when evaluating a treatment center. Lastly, consider what kind of specialized programs might be attractive and what a particular rehab provides. Examples of specialized recovery programs include faith-based recovery, medication-assisted treatment, yoga therapy, adventure therapy, and more.&nbsp;</p>

                           <p>Most people assume that they cannot afford private addiction treatment. However, many of even the most luxurious rehabs accept medical insurance which may cover the majority of the expense. Even state-funded insurance policies like Medicare and Medicaid offer coverage for substance abuse treatment.&nbsp;</p>

                <p class="display-7"> <p>Even though the process of detoxing from drugs and alcohol can be difficult however, there are many benefits to seeking help in rehab in Florida rehabilitation. For instance, the warm weather helps the body deal with the physical effects of withdrawal. There are withdrawal symptoms that can occur such as pain, insomnia, or flu-like symptoms. Colder weather can also worsen symptoms. Florida&#39;s climate makes it much easier to seek treatment. Furthermore, Florida is home to some of the nation&#39;s most highly trained medical and mental health specialists in the field of addiction.</p>

<p>The Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration conducts an annual survey that measures the availability of substance abuse treatment facilities across 50 states and the District of Columbia. According to the survey the number of facilities was 617 Florida rehab facilities in 2011. This reveals that Florida has a high demand for alcohol and drugs treatment. Fortunately, Florida is home to numerous reputable rehab facilities. The state is also close to several detox centers for alcohol. No matter where you reside, Florida has excellent treatment centers that can help you overcome your alcohol and drug addiction.</p>

<p>While Florida addiction treatment centers all share similar visions however, they differ in the services they offer. For example there aren&#39;t all Florida rehab centers offer detox programs, but the majority of them do. To detoxify the body of drugs, it is important that you undergo a medically-supervised detoxification process prior to beginning treatment. Not all Florida rehab centers offer dual-diagnosis or trauma treatment. Some offer a 14 - to 28-day treatment course while others provide extended or intensive programs.</p>
